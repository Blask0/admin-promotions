  "promotions.announcement.subtitle": "The new Promotions interface embeds simplicity with autonomy and many more customization possibilities.",
  "promotions.announcement.a1": "The promotions interface is ready to garner positive changes and grant new functionalities that will allow you to create and edit a promotion with ease.",
  "promotions.announcement.a2": "Over the next couple of months, several accounts will be handpicked to test and take advantage of this closed beta experience, confirming that it’s feasible to create promotions with ease, straightforwardly and without losing customization possibilities.",
  "promotions.announcement.b1": "What is a closed beta?",
  "promotions.announcement.b2": "A closed beta will grant you access to VTEX’s new Promotions panel, giving you firsthand access. But before you ask - a closed beta’s aim is not finding bugs. On the contrary! We are looking for clients who can put the solution that we’ve been developing for the last few months in practice. The objective of this closed beta is to evaluate the new feature’s impact and collect feedback on its day-to-day use. We will be monitoring its use from beginning to end, up to its final release.",
  "promotions.announcement.c1": "What are the new panel’s advantages?",
  "promotions.announcement.c2": "A more centralized view of all promotions, optimizing management;",

  "promotions.announcement.f2": "Customizing a promotion is simpler now. Previously, you had to identify all the items needed to fill out the customization on the same screen. Now, tabs appear according to your customization needs. The more specifications your promotion requires, the more options will pop up. Simple when need be, complex when you want to be as contextual as possible.",
  "promotions.announcement.f3": "The creation begins with the effect. We’ve put together the main promotion models in a simple and straightforward selection. Choose between a Price, Gift or Shipping promotion, accordingly;",
  "promotions.announcement.f4": "Gain more power to segment and to make your promotion as contextual as possible with the new way of creating conditions. Combine conditions - from UTM to payment method, brand, product, etc - with even more prowess.",
